# V10. Exponential Backoff
# Problem: Implement an exponential backoff strategy that doubles the wait time between retries, starting
# from 1 second, but stops after 5 retries.

import time

wait_time = 1  # starting wait time in seconds
max_retries = 5
attempts = 0

while attempts < max_retries:
    print("Attempt", attempts + 1,"- wait time",wait_time)
    time.sleep(wait_time)
    wait_time *= 2
    attempts += 1
